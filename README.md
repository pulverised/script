## Using Exploit Scripts

Installation / Usage:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open your Roblox Executor / Roblox app if mobile.
3. Only for PC --> Once you joined a game inject the executor.
   Mobile already injects as soon as you join a game!
4. Paste the script in and execute snd have fun!


Executors Compatibility:
These scripts have been tested with most popular Roblox Lua executors, including:
- Free executors: KRNL, JJSploit, Fluxus Lite
- Paid executors: Synapse X, ProtoSmasher
- Lite / script-friendly executors: WeAreDevs, SirHurt Lite

Notes:
- Some scripts may require a more powerful executor to run correctly.
- Executors may be updated by their developers; always use the latest version for best compatibility.
- Mobile executors are not officially supported. Only a fair few are such as; Krnl and Codex.
